I find it easy to forget what it's like to be a beginner. My memories of being a young girl learning tennis are limited (aside from the emotions of terrible losses and glorious wins). Now, I step out on to the tennis court with ease, and although I'm no Roger Federer, I've been complimented on my smooth strokes from time to time. How do I hit that forehand? I actually have no idea. I just step out on to the court and stick out my racquet, really. 

It's easy to document the feelings of being a noob, when you are in fact, a Noob.

So here I am, a Noob, learning how to code. 

Although imposter syndrome will likely keep me from ever being able to call myself an "expert" at this stuff, I hope to one day become at least a master. 

I'm currently at step 1: attending App Academy, a coding bootcamp. I'll be starting Feb 27th, 2017 in NYC and will be documenting feelings throughout(hopefully).
